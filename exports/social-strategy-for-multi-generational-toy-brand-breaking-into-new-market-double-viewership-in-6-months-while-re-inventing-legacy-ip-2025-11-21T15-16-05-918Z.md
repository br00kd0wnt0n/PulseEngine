### 1. Leverage User-Generated Content Over Brand-Controlled Marketing

Why Contrarian:

- Conventional wisdom suggests brands should maintain strict control over their messaging.
- User-generated content can enhance authenticity and resonate more with younger audiences.

Evidence: ctx5, ctx6, ctx1

Upside: Potentially increases engagement and viewership from a broader audience, especially if the content goes viral.

Risks:

- Loss of brand control over messaging and potential negative user interpretations.
- Inconsistent quality of content may misalign with brand image.

Test Plan:

- Launch a campaign inviting customers to share their own stories or experiences related to the toy brand using a specific hashtag.
- Measure engagement rates, views, and sentiment analysis on shared posts compared to traditional marketing efforts.

First Step: Create a compelling launch post that outlines the campaign and encourages participation by highlighting an incentive.

### 2. Target 'Nostalgia Marketing' Towards Parents Instead of Kids

Why Contrarian:

- 'Traditional targeting focuses on children, but parents are key decision-makers in purchasing toys.'
- 'Appealing to nostalgia may boost sales among parents who remember the legacy IP fondly.'

Evidence: ctx3, ctx4, ctx2

Upside: 'By focusing on parents’ nostalgic feelings, it can lead to increased purchases for gifts during holidays or special occasions.'

Risks:

- 'Might alienate younger audiences who don’t have an attachment to the legacy IP.'
- 'Can appear outdated if not executed with modern sensibilities in mind.'

Test Plan:

- 'Develop targeted ads specifically addressing parents on platforms like Facebook and Instagram emphasizing nostalgic themes.'
- 'Analyze conversion rates versus standard child-focused advertisements over a six-month period.'

First Step: 'Craft ad creatives that evoke nostalgia while showcasing how the legacy toys have evolved for today’s kids.'
