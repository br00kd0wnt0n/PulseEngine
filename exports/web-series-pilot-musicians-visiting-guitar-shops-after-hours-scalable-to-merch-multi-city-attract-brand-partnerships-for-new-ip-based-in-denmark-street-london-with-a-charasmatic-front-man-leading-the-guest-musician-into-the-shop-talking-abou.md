Strict rules:
- No generic advice; do not restate any existing narrative or debrief.
- Each idea must clearly challenge common platform tactics or biases and include at least one trade‑off.
- Each idea MUST include exactly 3 evidence citations using id format like "ctx3" that map to the provided context.
- Be specific, quantified where possible.

Output ONLY strict JSON with this schema and keys, no prose:

```

</details>

### 1. Late-Night Live Streaming from Guitar Shops

Why Contrarian:

- Default assumption is that live content should be produced during peak hours for maximum viewership.
- Challenging this, the intimacy of late-night sessions can create a unique atmosphere, attracting dedicated fans and niche audiences.

Evidence: ctx1, ctx5, ctx6

Upside: Potential for higher engagement rates due to a more intimate viewing experience, appealing to hardcore music fans who thrive in niche environments.

Risks:

- Lower initial viewer numbers compared to daytime slots might lead to slower brand partnership growth.
- Increased production costs associated with late-night staffing and security at guitar shops.

Test Plan:

- Conduct a trial live stream event at different times (late-night vs. daytime) to measure viewer engagement and interaction.
- Survey viewers post-stream about their preferences for time slots and content types.

First Step: Schedule a late-night live streaming event at a popular guitar shop and promote it through social media channels targeting local musicians.

### 2. Merchandising Limited-Edition Music Gear Collaborations

Why Contrarian:

- Common belief is that merchandise should focus solely on branded apparel or general music-related items.
- Instead, collaborating with guitar shops to create limited-edition music gear can differentiate the merch line and draw collectors.

Evidence: ctx2, ctx4, ctx3

Upside: $$ potential from sales of unique gear not available elsewhere could attract partnerships with both brands and retailers looking for exclusivity.

Risks:

- $$ investment in producing exclusive items may not yield immediate returns if demand doesn't meet expectations.
- 'Limited edition' can backfire if perceived as gimmicky rather than authentic.

Test Plan:

- $$ conduct market research via polls on social media platforms to gauge interest in specific types of gear before launch.
- $$ pilot an initial drop of limited-edition products during a show episode release, measuring sales against typical merch offerings.

First Step: $$ Reach out to local guitar shops for collaboration proposals focusing on creating exclusive gear tied to featured episodes.
