```

</details>

### 1. Focus on Gear Over Artists

Why Contrarian:

- Common belief emphasizes the celebrity of musicians over the stories behind the gear.
- Highlighting unique equipment and its history can attract more niche audiences and collectors.

Evidence: ctx3, ctx4, ctx6

Upside: Positioning the web series as a cultural exploration of music gear can open doors to partnerships with vintage shops and brands specializing in musical equipment.

Risks:

- May alienate casual viewers who prefer celebrity culture.
- Potential difficulty in maintaining viewer interest without consistent star power.

Test Plan:

- Pilot episode focusing primarily on a rare guitar's story rather than an artist's performance.
- Gather viewer feedback through social media polls post-episode release.

First Step: Create a teaser highlighting the gear-centric narrative for social media distribution.

### 2. Late Night Live Streaming Sessions

Why Contrarian:

- Default strategies often ignore late-night content, assuming low viewership during these hours.
- Engaging audiences after-hours could tap into a dedicated night owl community, increasing interaction.

Evidence: ctx2, ctx5, ctx1

Upside: $$ Potentially higher engagement rates with unexpected guest musicians joining live streams spontaneously.

Risks:

- Variable quality control during live sessions may lead to inconsistent production value.
- 'Night owl' audience might not align with typical brand partnerships' targets.

Test Plan:

- 'Pop-up' late-night livestream events featuring impromptu jam sessions or discussions around gear.
- [Monitor engagement metrics like viewer counts and comments during these streams versus regular uploads.]

First Step: 'Schedule' initial test livestream with advance notice, promoting it across all channels to build anticipation.
