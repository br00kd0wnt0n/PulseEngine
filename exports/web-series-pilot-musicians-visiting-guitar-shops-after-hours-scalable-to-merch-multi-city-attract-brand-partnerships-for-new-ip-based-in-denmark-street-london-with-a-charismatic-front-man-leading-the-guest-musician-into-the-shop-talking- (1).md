### 1. Merchandising Nostalgia: The Dark Side of Music Memorabilia

Why Contrarian:

- Current assumptions prioritize live interactions with musicians and merchandise tied to mainstream success.
- This insight suggests exploring the underground music scene and vintage memorabilia as a more engaging angle that connects deeper with audiences.

Evidence: ctx3, ctx4, ctx6

Upside: Tapping into niche markets can lead to unique partnerships with vintage shops and increase brand loyalty among dedicated fans.

Risks:

- Potential alienation of casual music fans who prefer mainstream content.
- Logistical challenges in sourcing rare items for merchandising.

Test Plan:

- Launch a pilot episode focused on an underground musician visiting a vintage guitar shop, highlighting memorabilia.
- Utilize social media platforms to gauge audience engagement through polls and comments before full rollout.

First Step: Identify and partner with a local vintage guitar shop willing to host the pilot episode.

### 2. Global Virtual Jam Sessions: Beyond In-Person Guitar Shops

Why Contrarian:

- Assuming the appeal lies only in physical visits limits audience reach and overlooks the potential for digital engagement.
- Exploring virtual sessions could attract international musicians and fans, creating a scalable model without geographical limitations.

Evidence: ctx5, ctx2, ctx1

Upside: Expanding globally through virtual formats can significantly lower production costs while increasing viewership and merch sales across multiple cities.

Risks:

- Technical difficulties may impact production quality and viewer experience.
- The challenge of maintaining genuine interactions in a digital format.

Test Plan:

- Conduct an online event featuring musicians from different countries jamming together using a platform like Instagram Live or Zoom.
- Collect data on viewer interaction, attendance numbers, and potential merchandise interest through follow-up surveys.

First Step: Select a diverse group of musicians interested in participating in a virtual jam session and schedule the event.
