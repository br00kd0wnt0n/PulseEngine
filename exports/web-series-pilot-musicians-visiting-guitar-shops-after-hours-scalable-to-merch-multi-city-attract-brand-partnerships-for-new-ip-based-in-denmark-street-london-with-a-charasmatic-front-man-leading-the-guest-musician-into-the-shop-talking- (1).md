Strict rules:
- No generic advice; do not restate any existing narrative or debrief.
- Each idea must clearly challenge common platform tactics or biases and include at least one trade‑off.
- Each idea MUST include exactly 3 evidence citations using id format like "ctx3" that map to the provided context.
- Be specific, quantified where possible.

Output ONLY strict JSON with this schema and keys, no prose:
{ "ideas": [ { "title": string, "contrarianWhy": string[], "evidence": string[], "upside": string, "risks": string[], "testPlan": string[], "firstStep": string } ] }
```

</details>

### 1. Embrace Imperfection: Go Live with Minimal Editing

Why Contrarian:

- Current belief is that highly edited content performs better.
- Live, unedited content can create authentic engagement and spontaneity.

Evidence: ctx5, ctx6, ctx3

Upside: Potentially higher viewer retention and interaction rates as audiences feel more connected.

Risks:

- Technical issues could lead to awkward moments.
- Audience may not respond well to lack of production quality initially.

Test Plan:

- Conduct a live session in a guitar shop with the charismatic front-man and guest musician.
- Engage viewers through Q&A during the stream.
- Analyze viewer metrics compared to pre-recorded episodes.

First Step: Schedule and promote a live session for this week, inviting followers to join in real-time.

### 2. Crowdsourced Storytelling: Let Fans Choose Gear & Stories

Why Contrarian:

- Assumption is that creators should dictate content flow and topics.
- Leveraging audience input can foster deeper community ties and investment in the series.

Evidence: ctx4, ctx2, ctx1

Upside: Enhanced viewer loyalty and excitement about participating in content creation, leading to increased shares and word-of-mouth marketing.

Risks:

- Content may veer off-topic based on audience suggestions.
- Diverse opinions might lead to conflict or confusion within the community.

Test Plan:

- Launch a poll asking followers which rare gear they want highlighted next or which musician's story they wish to hear.
- Collect responses over a week and create content based on popular votes.
- Track engagement levels on chosen stories vs. creator-selected topics.

First Step: Create an engaging social media post this week announcing the crowdsourcing idea and invite fan submissions.
